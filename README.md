This is the code repository for [Unity Artificial Intelligence Programming](Packt UTM URL of the Book), published by Packt.

**Add powerful, believable, and fun AI entities in your game with the power of Unity 2018!**

## What is this book about?
Developing Artificial Intelligence (AI) for game characters in Unity 2018 has never been easier. Unity provides game and app developers with a variety of tools to implement AI, from the basic techniques to cutting-edge machine learning-powered agents. Leveraging these tools via Unity's API or built-in features allows limitless possibilities when it comes to creating your game's worlds and characters.

This book covers the following exciting features: <First 5 What you'll learn points>
* Create smarter game worlds and characters with C# programming
* Apply automated character movement using pathfinding and steering behaviors
* Implement non-player character decision-making algorithms using Behavior Trees and FSMs
* Build believable and highly efficient artificial flocks and crowds
* Create sensory systems for your AI with the most commonly used techniques

The code will look like the following:
```
int throwDiceLoaded() { 
    Debug.Log("Throwing dice..."); 
      int randomProbability = Random.Range(1,101); 
      int diceResult = 0; 
      if (randomProbability < 36) { 
        diceResult = 6; 
      } 
      else { 
        diceResult = Random.Range(1,5); 
      } 
    Debug.Log("Result: " + diceResult); 
      return diceResult; 
  }
```
